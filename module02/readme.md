# module02 - TypeError, Type Check, Type Conversion, try-except and if
The objective of the module is to present strategies on how we can prevent errors from happening.We will look at some simple error handling and error workaround practices.

We will review what we studied in module01 about variables.

And finally, we'll talk about flows. What is the behavior like within **Python**.

### Topics:
Python supports several simple data types such as:

- **Integers (`int`)**: Represent whole numbers.
- **Floating Point (`float`)**: Represent real numbers.
- **Strings (`str`)**: Represent sequences of characters.
- **Booleans (`bool`)**: Represent true (`True`) or false (`False`) values.

#### 1. Integers (`int`)

* **Methods and operations:**
    1. `+` (addition)
    2. `-` (subtraction)
    3. `*` (multiplication)
    4. `//` (integer division)
    5. `%` (modulo - remainder of division)

#### 2. Floating Point Numbers (`float`)

* **Methods and operations:**
    1. `+` (addition)
    2. `-` (subtraction)
    3. `*` (multiplication)
    4. `/` (division)
    5. `**` (empowerment)

#### 3. Strings (`str`)

* **Methods and operations:**
    1. `.upper()` (converts to uppercase)
    2. `.lower()` (converts to lowercase)
    3. `.strip()` (removes leading and trailing whitespace)
    4. `.split(sep)` (splits the string into a list, using `sep` as delimiter)
    5. `+` (string concatenation)

#### 4. Booleans (`bool`)

* **Logical operations:**
    1. `and` (logical And)
    2. `or` (logical OR)
    3. `not` (NOT logical)
    4. `==` (equality)
    5. `!=` (difference)
