# Integers (`int`)

## 1. Write a program that adds two integers entered by the user.
value1 = input("Please, enter a integer number: ")
value2 = input("Please, enter another integer number: ")
total1 = int(value1) + int(value2)
print(total1)

## 2. Create a program that receives a number from the user and calculates the remainder of dividing that number by 5.
value3 = input("Please, enter a integer number: ")
total2 = int(value3) % 5
print(total2)

## 3. Develop a program that multiplies two numbers provided by the user and displays the result.
value4 = input("Please, enter a integer number: ")
value5 = input("Please, enter another integer number: ")
total3 = int(value4) * int(value5)
print(total3)

## 4. Write a program that asks for two integers and prints the integer division of the first by the second.
value6 = input("Please, enter a integer number: ")
value7 = input("Please, enter aanother integer number: ")
total4 = int(value6) / int(value7)
print(total4)

## 5. Write a program that calculates the square of a user-supplied number.
value8 = input("Please, enter a integer number: ")
total5 = int(value8) ** 2
print(total5)

# Floating Point Numbers (`float`)
